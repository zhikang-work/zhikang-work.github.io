I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon AGI working on multimodal data preparation for foundation model training. Prior to joining AGI, I worked at [Prime Video](https://www.primevideotech.com/) on video understanding. My research interest is on multimodal learning, computer vision and signal processing. 

I received my Ph.D. Degree (2023) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) supervised by [Prof. Fengbo Ren](https://ren-fengbo.lab.asu.edu/content/fengbo-ren). I received my Bachelor's Degree (2016) at [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
